Hello,

I am Oliver Franke.

You can find here two repositories containing two of my OOP-projects I was working on during my studies at univeristy as a student and research assistant.
Please note that these projects were originally not designed to be seen by a public audience.
Therefore, they are not perfectly polished regarding professional software development standards.
Instead, the projects should be seen as representations of the status quo of my academic coding style at that time.

The first OOP-project is written in C++ implementing a Monte Carlo method for simulating the dipole-dipole interactions of a magnetic cubic chain.
The second OOP-project is written in Python calculating the surface flux integrals of a fluid vector field over an interpolated surface region.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I have also uploaded my master's thesis in a single repository as a PDF.
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions regarding my research or my coding projects!

Have a nice day. :)
